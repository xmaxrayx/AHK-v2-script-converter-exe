Afterwards you can investigate the converted version for other minor changes that the converter didn’t cover.\nI took Frankie’s original converter linked below, and updated it to work with the latest AHK v2 alpha build.\nI’ve also added essential unit tests using the Yunit framework to encourage contributions from others.\nHowever, this project is way more ambitious that I originally thought, and it needs a lot of work. See below for how you can contribute."

The interpreter alone does nothing without passing a script to it. But here, we take advantage of the default scriptfile feature where the Tests.exe file will look for a file named Tests.ahk and automatically run it. You can make changes to the .ahk file and then just run the .exe. The reason for doing this is because most people will still have AHK v1 installed and associated with *.ahk files. So it would be inconvenient to run this converter without some workarounds. Likewise, the diff\\VisualDiff.exe file (as well as the AutoHotKey Exe\\AutoHotKeyV1.exe file) is just a renamed AutoHotkeyU32-v1.1.24.02.exe"
